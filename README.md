# Tetris_Using_Pygame
A tetris game we used to play in earlier days, using Python3 library Pygame.
You have to set the falling blocks in such a way to form a complete horizontal line, there are various types of blocks in term of shape and size, they can be rotated by the user while playing to adjust them to fill a row.
Once a row is completed is get disappeared and the score get updated.
But if the column get filled the game ends.
Score as much as you can!!
